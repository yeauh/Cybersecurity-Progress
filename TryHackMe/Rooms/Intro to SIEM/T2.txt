Each network component can have one or more log sources generating different logs. We can divide our network log sources into two logical parts: Host-Centric Log Sources and Network-Centric Log Sources.

1) Host-Centric Log Sources
	Captures that occurred within or related to the host.
	Some examples of host-centric logs are:
		- A user accessing a file
		- A user attempting to authenticate
		- A process Execution Activity
		- Powershell execution

2) Network-Centric Log Sources
	Network-related logs when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website. Some network-based protocols are SSH, VPN, HTTP/s, FTP, etc.
	Examples of such events are:
		-  SSH connection
		- A file being accessed via FTP
		- Web traffic
		- A user accessing company's resources through VPN
		- Network file sharing Activity
